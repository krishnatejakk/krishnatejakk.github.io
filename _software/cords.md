Please find the github link for CORDS repo [here](https://github.com/decile-team/cords).

A COReset and Data Selection library for making machine learning time-, energy-, cost-, and compute-efficient. Using state-of-the-art subset selection techniques, CORDS leverages the deep learning framework provided by PyTorch to greatly reduce training time, energy demand, and other resource requirements demanded by deep learning while not sacrificing model performance.
