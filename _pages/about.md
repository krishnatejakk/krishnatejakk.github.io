Hi there! I'm Krishnateja Killamsetty, a passionate researcher in the field of machine learning and AI. I recently completed my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Dallas, where I had the pleasure of working in the [CARAML Lab](https://www.caraml-lab.com/) under the guidance of [Dr. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home?authuser=0). It was an incredible journey filled with exciting challenges and opportunities to grow as a researcher.

Now, I'm thrilled to be a Research Scientist at IBM Almaden Research Center, where I'm working on developing in-house conversational AI models for enterprise applications. My focus is on data subset selection and targeted synthetic data generation, aiming to make machine learning models more efficient and robust. I'm particularly excited about the potential of these techniques to achieve significant speedups, energy savings, and even reduced CO2 emissions.

My research interests lie in developing techniques that analyze the importance of data samples and leverage the underlying data structure to achieve data-efficiency, compute-efficiency, and robustness. I'm also keen on building machine learning systems that can learn efficiently from massive amounts of data, even when the labels are noisy or the classes are imbalanced. It's a challenging but incredibly rewarding field of study.

I'm always eager to collaborate and discuss ideas with fellow researchers and enthusiasts. If you're interested in learning more about my work, feel free to explore my [research](/research) and [publications](/publications) pages. I believe that by working together, we can push the boundaries of AI and make a positive impact on the world, one efficient algorithm at a time.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing more about my passion for machine learning and AI!
