Hi there! I'm Krishnateja Killamsetty, a researcher and innovator in machine learning and AI with a passion for developing efficient, robust, and scalable systems. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas under the guidance of [Dr. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home?authuser=0) at the CARAML Lab—a transformative experience that honed my expertise in data subset selection and efficient learning algorithms.

Today, I serve as a Staff Research Scientist and Product Team Lead at IBM Almaden Research Center. In this role, I lead cross-functional teams to design and deploy state-of-the-art conversational AI models for enterprise applications. My current research focuses on developing data-efficient techniques—such as advanced subset selection and targeted synthetic data generation—that drive significant speedups, reduce energy consumption, and pave the way for sustainable AI solutions. I’m particularly excited about leveraging these innovations to create intelligent systems that perform robustly even with limited or noisy data.

My research interests span:
- **Data-Efficient Learning:** Crafting algorithms that identify and utilize the most informative data samples, achieving high performance with fewer resources.
- **Conversational & Generative AI:** Building and refining models that power seamless human-computer interactions across various enterprise platforms.
- **Robust and Scalable Systems:** Designing end-to-end pipelines that ensure machine learning models are both production-ready and resilient in real-world environments.

I’m dedicated to advancing the frontier of AI and regularly contribute to top-tier conferences like ICLR, ICML, CVPR, NeurIPS, AAAI, and more. Beyond research, I actively support the community through roles on program committees and as a reviewer for premier journals and conferences.

If you’re curious to learn more about my work or explore collaboration opportunities, please visit my [research](/research) and [publications](/publications) pages. I’m always excited to connect with fellow researchers, engineers, and innovators who share a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI.

Thank you for stopping by and getting to know me. Let’s work together to build smarter, more efficient, and transformative AI solutions!
